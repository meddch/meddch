😄 Fun Fact: Here's an interesting tidbit for you! The first computer bug wasn't a software issue, but rather a real insect. In 1947, a moth was discovered inside the Harvard Mark II computer, causing a malfunction. This incident led to the term "debugging" being coined to describe the process of removing errors or bugs from computer software. It's a quirky piece of history that showcases the unexpected challenges that can arise in the world of technology!
